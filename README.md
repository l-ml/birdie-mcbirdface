# Birdie McBirdface

A small Twitter "clone" using GraphQL (Apollo Server + Client) and React.

This repository is meant to be used in a workshop including other instructions and guidance (if interested contact me).

If you're not attending the workshop you are probably most interested in `finalised-app` folder. Otherwise the application has been splitted into different steps, including:
* `step0` - The starting point, we will add log in, sign up and authentication in this part
* `step1` - Logging in, signing up and authentication included, next up implementing messaging
* `step2` - Messaging included, we will continue making it real-time with adding GraphQL subscriptions

## Use instructions

Start from one of the steps or go directly to `finalised-app`, then:

1. Open `client` folder in one terminal window and `server` folder in another
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn` in both windows
3. Run `npm start` or `yarn start` in both windows
